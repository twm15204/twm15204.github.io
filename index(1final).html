<p> This upcoming year, many big names and powerhouses of international soccer are missing the World Cup. This has been one of the most competitive qualifying rounds in World Cup Qualifying history that sees defending two-time Copa America (continental tournament between South American and some North/Central American countries), Chile, miss out on all the fun. Also world powerhouse Italy, who won the World Cup in 2006, will sit this one out, as well. Perhaps the most disappointing is the United States missing out on next year's tournament. Normally a regular World Cup-goer, the US tragically did not qualify despite being the second best team on the continent.
